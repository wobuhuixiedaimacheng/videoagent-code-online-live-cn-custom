# Course Promo — Educational Product Video Prompts

---

## Seedance 2.0 Input Specifications

Seedance 2.0 accepts multi-modal inputs and produces short-form cinematic video output. Before writing any prompt, confirm the assets available:

**Image inputs** — up to 9 images
- Reference the first image as `@material[image1]`, second as `@material[image2]`, and so on
- Use for: instructor headshots, course mockups, student result screenshots, before/after photos, slide previews, community screenshots, device mockups showing the course platform

**Video inputs** — up to 3 short video clips
- Reference as `@material[video1]`, `@material[video2]`, `@material[video3]`
- Use for: existing testimonial clips, talking-head snippets, screen recordings of the course interface, b-roll of the instructor in action

**Audio inputs** — up to 3 audio files
- Reference as `@material[audio1]`, `@material[audio2]`, `@material[audio3]`
- Use for: background music track, voiceover narration, sound effects layer

**Output specs**
- Duration: 4–15 seconds per generation
- Resolution: 720p
- Aspect ratios: 9:16 (Reels/TikTok/Shorts), 16:9 (YouTube/Webinar landing), 1:1 (Feed)
- Chaining multiple generations creates a full 30–90 second promo sequence

**Prompt length sweet spot:** 120–250 words per generation. Too short = generic output. Too long = model ignores later instructions.

## Asset Checklist Before Writing Any Prompt

Before generating a prompt, answer these questions:

- [ ] What is the course/program name and price point?
- [ ] What is the primary platform (Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, email)?
- [ ] What is the video duration target?
- [ ] What assets are available? (List all images, videos, audio files with their @material tags)
- [ ] Who is the target student? (One sentence description of their current painful state)
- [ ] What is the single transformation promise? (One sentence: "Go from X to Y in Z time")
- [ ] What is the CTA action? (Register, buy, apply, watch, join — pick one)
- [ ] Is there a deadline or urgency element? (Enrollment closing, live event date, bonus expiring)

---

## Philosophy

Every course promo follows one arc:

`Hook (tension/curiosity) → Evidence (authority/social proof) → Transformation (the future state) → CTA (one clear next step)`

---

## 2-Second Hook Patterns

The hook is the first 2 seconds of the video. It must work without sound. Design it visually before writing anything else.

| Hook Pattern | Visual Signal | Emotional Mechanism | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Knowledge Gap** | Split screen: wrong way (frustrated, messy desk, error screen) vs. right way (clean, confident, results visible) | Curiosity + mild anxiety relief | Skill-based courses, coding, design, marketing |
| **The Transformation Promise** | Single subject, before posture vs. after posture in rapid cut — slouched scrolling phone → standing confident, phone showing income notification | Hope + aspiration | Coaching programs, fitness, business, mindset |
| **The Exclusive Access** | Camera slowly pushes through a half-open door into a warmly lit room with a whiteboard full of insider frameworks — the viewer is being let in | Intrigue + belonging | Masterclasses, premium memberships, inner circles |
| **The Social Proof Flash** | Rapid montage of 4–6 results cards or testimonial stills, each on screen for 12 frames — too fast to read fully but pattern-registers as "many people succeeded" | FOMO + credibility | Established courses with a results library |
| **The Authority Reveal** | Close-up of hands writing a key framework on paper or whiteboard, camera slowly pulls back to reveal the instructor's confident face | Respect + curiosity | Expert-led programs, consulting, high-ticket coaching |
| **The Relatable Struggle** | Single frame of a person staring at a blinking cursor, overflowing inbox, or blank spreadsheet — paused in the moment before the breakthrough | Empathy + identification | Any course solving a specific frustrating problem |

**Hook construction rule:** Write the hook shot description first. If you cannot describe it in one sentence that would make sense to a stranger, it is not specific enough.

## Visual Style Templates

### Template A — The Classroom Cinematic

**Mood:** Warm, expert, aspirational. Feels like a premium Netflix documentary about a genius teacher.

**Core visual grammar:**
- Deep focus on the instructor, soft bokeh on background bookshelves or whiteboards
- Color grade: warm tones, slightly desaturated highlights, rich shadow detail (not crushed blacks)
- Camera movement: slow push-in on instructor face during key points; static wide during environment reveals
- Text overlays: clean serif or geometric sans, large single words, white with subtle drop shadow
- Transitions: hard cuts within sequences, slow dissolves between sections

**When to use:** High-ticket coaching (>$1,000), professional skill courses (law, finance, medicine), executive education

**Input pairing:** Works best with `@material[image1]` as an instructor headshot + `@material[image2]` as a bookshelf or office environment

---

### Template B — The Screen-to-Reality

**Mood:** Kinetic, modern, "I can do this." Bridges the gap between the digital learning environment and the real-world outcome.

**Core visual grammar:**
- Split-plane composition: one half shows course interface/screen, other half shows the real-world application
- Color grade: cooler, higher contrast, punchy highlights — feels like a tech product ad
- Camera movement: fast parallax on split-plane elements, snappy cuts at beat drops
- Text overlays: bold geometric sans, full-bleed color banners, numbered lists that build on screen
- Transitions: whip pans, zoom cuts, clean smash cuts

**When to use:** Online courses where the skill is digital (coding, design, social media, AI tools), SaaS tutorial content, productivity training

**Input pairing:** `@material[video1]` as screen recording of the platform + `@material[image1]` as student success outcome photo

---

### Template C — The Knowledge Montage

**Mood:** Fast-paced, energetic, "there's so much value here." Creates a sense of abundance and proof of content depth.

**Core visual grammar:**
- Rapid-fire sequence of 8–12 visual moments, each 1–2 seconds, set to a single music track
- Mix of: writing-on-whiteboard, graph/chart reveals, student reaction moments, product/device mockups, instructor gestures
- Color grade: consistent LUT across all clips — choose one (warm film, clean digital, moody dark)
- Camera movement: mostly static or subtle push-in per clip; movement comes from cuts, not camera work
- Text overlays: counter-style numbers ("47 lessons," "3,200+ students," "Week 1 result:"), appearing via quick fade

**When to use:** Webinar replay promotion, course launch week, social media ads where you want high information density, email header videos

**Input pairing:** Maximum inputs — fill all 9 image slots and 3 video slots; the montage needs variety to work

---

## Lighting Presets

Lighting is the single biggest variable Seedance 2.0 responds to for "feel." Always specify it explicitly.

### Academy Clean
```
Lighting: soft box key light at 45 degrees camera left, white fill card camera right,
practical lamp in background slightly overexposed for warmth, no harsh shadows,
color temperature 4800K, slight warm gel on key
```
**Effect:** Professional, trustworthy, accessible. Works at all price points.
**Avoid for:** Luxury/high-ticket programs (too approachable, not exclusive enough)

---

### Moody Expert
```
Lighting: single hard key light from above-left casting strong facial shadow,
deep background with single warm practical source (lamp or candle),
color temperature 3200K on key, 2700K on background practical,
subtle blue-teal rim light from camera-right for dimension
```
**Effect:** Authority, depth, seriousness. The viewer senses this person knows things others don't.
**Best for:** High-ticket coaching, leadership programs, financial education, legal/professional training

---

### Warm Workshop
```
Lighting: large window-light simulation (soft, directional, slightly cool at 5500K),
warm practical sources scattered in background (3000K),
no visible shadows — diffused and even — feels like a well-lit creative studio,
slight fill from a white V-flat to open up shadows
```
**Effect:** Friendly, creative, hands-on. Like learning in a bright studio with your favorite teacher.
**Best for:** Creative courses (design, photography, writing), DIY/craft education, wellness coaching, community-driven programs

---

## Sound Design

Sound is specified in the prompt but rendered by Seedance 2.0 based on audio inputs and description. Always specify three layers.

### Music Templates

**Track A — "The Climb"**
```
Music: orchestral build starting with solo piano, strings entering at 4 seconds,
full ensemble at 8 seconds, tempo 72 BPM, key of D major, no percussion until 10 seconds,
emotional tone: hopeful determination
```
Use for: transformation story arcs, before/after reveals, coaching program main promos

**Track B — "Momentum"**
```
Music: modern cinematic electronic, four-on-the-floor kick at 120 BPM starting immediately,
pulsing bass, bright synthesizer lead entering at 3 seconds,
emotional tone: confidence, forward motion, unstoppable
```
Use for: skill-based courses, launch week urgency content, social media ads

**Track C — "Deep Work"**
```
Music: minimal lo-fi piano, 80 BPM, subtle vinyl texture, no melody — just rhythm and texture,
single bass note pads underneath, emotional tone: focused calm, intellectual depth
```
Use for: webinar promotions, educational content trailers, long-form course previews

### Voice Template

When including voiceover narration (via `@material[audio1]` or prompted):

```
Voiceover: [gender/tone descriptor] voice, warm and direct, speaking at 140 words per minute,
no music during voiceover — underscore only (music at -18dB),
voice enters at [timestamp], one breath between each key statement,
tone is [choose: authoritative / conversational / conspiratorial / celebratory]
```

warm. No text overlay. No music. Only ambient room tone.
The viewer should feel: "I want to see what that whole framework says."

```
Seedance 2.0 prompt — 10 seconds, 1:1 square, knowledge montage social ad

OVERALL TREATMENT
Color grade consistent across all clips: warm film LUT — lifted blacks, slightly orange
midtones, teal-green shadows, bright whites. High energy. Every cut lands on a music beat.

BEAT 1 [0:00–0:01]
@material[image2] — student desk setup — camera static, wide.
Text overlay center-top: "Still living in chaos?" — white bold sans, fast fade in at 0:00,
out at 0:01. The word "chaos" is 20% larger than the rest.

BEAT 2 [0:01–0:02]
@material[image3] — before/after Notion — camera starts on the "before" (messy) side,
fast pan right to land on "after" (clean and structured). Duration: 1 second.
No text overlay. Let the visual contrast speak.

BEAT 3 [0:02–0:04]
@material[video1] — screen recording of Notion template — play at 1.5x speed.
Camera motion: subtle zoom-in on the most impressive section of the template.
Text overlay at 0:02, left-aligned lower third: "The exact system →" — white arrow
included, type appears character by character at 60 chars/second.

BEAT 4 [0:04–0:05]

then holds for 0.5s. White bold numerals, large scale (40% of frame height for number).

BEAT 5 [0:05–0:07]
@material[image5] — testimonial card — push-in from 95% to 100% scale over 2 seconds.
Text overlay below card: "Real student. Real week 2." — small italic caption, white.

BEAT 6 [0:07–0:09]
@material[image4] — instructor portrait — camera slow push-in, Academy Clean lighting
treatment. Text overlay: instructor first name only, large, upper-third, white.
Below name, smaller: "Notion Consultant · 6 years" — appears 0.5s after name.

BEAT 7 [0:09–0:10]
Hard cut to brand color background (specify hex). Single CTA text: "Grab the system."
Text scales from 80% to 105% (slight overshoot spring animation) and holds.
URL or handle appears 0.3s after headline. Music: final beat lands on cut to CTA,
then one-frame drum hit, then sustained pad to end.
```

### Example 4 — Webinar Registration Urgency Video (9:16, 8 seconds)

**Use case:** Instagram Stories countdown ad for a live webinar happening in 48 hours. Minimal assets — one image and music only.

---

```
Seedance 2.0 prompt — 8 seconds, 9:16 vertical, webinar urgency story ad

HOOK [0:00–0:02]
@material[image1] treated with digital split-leak effect: sharp vertical light streak
across center of frame, as if the image is "loading in." Warm Moody Expert grade —
hard directional light, deep background, teal rim light.
Text overlay at 0:00: "48 hours." — single phrase, massive type (50% frame width),
center frame, white, no animation — hard cut on with the image.
Sound: @material[audio1] music enters — tense, pulsing, electronic, 120 BPM,
no melody yet — just rhythm and tension.

BRIDGE [0:02–0:05]
Camera slow push-in on instructor face. Same grade.
Text sequence (each line replaces previous via hard cut timed to music beat):
0:02 — "I'm going live."
0:03 — "One time only."
0:04 — "No replay."
Each line: centered, bold white sans, 60% frame width. Rhythm matches beat.
Sound: synthesizer melody enters at 0:03, building.

CTA [0:05–0:08]
Hard cut to solid dark background (brand color or near-black).
Large white headline: "Register Free — Link in Bio"
Below: date, time, and timezone in smaller weight type.
Swipe-up arrow animation (if platform supports) — simple upward loop, 2px white line.
Sound: music peaks, single satisfying transient hit on cut, then fades fast to silence
over final 2 seconds — leaving the CTA in silence for maximum readability.
```

## Prompt Construction Rules

**Rule 1 — Write the emotional target, not just the visual.**
At least once per section, state: "The viewer should feel: [specific emotion]." This directly influences Seedance 2.0's color, pacing, and performance choices.

**Rule 2 — CTA is always a hard cut.**
Soft fades reduce click-through. Always: "Hard cut to [background]. [CTA text]. [Duration held]."

**Rule 3 — Match video length to platform.**
- Instagram/TikTok Stories or Reels: 6–10 seconds
- YouTube pre-roll: 10–15 seconds (hook before 5s skip button)
- Facebook Feed: 8–12 seconds
- Webinar landing page header: 12–15 seconds (looping)
- Email header GIF export: 4–6 seconds

**Rule 4 — Chain generations for complete videos.**
One generation = 4–15 seconds. For a 30-second ad, write 3 separate prompts (Hook + Body + CTA) and chain them in the Higgsfield timeline editor.
